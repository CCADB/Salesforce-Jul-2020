    <textOnly>Dear Certification Authority,

This is a courtesy reminder from Mozilla that audit statements or CP/CPS documents are missing for the following intermediate certificate records in the Common CA Database (CCADB):  

{!IntermediateCertificateList}  

For each of the certificates listed above, please update their record in the CCADB to provide audit and policy information as described here:

https://ccadb.org/cas/

This is an automated email that will be sent regularly until the audit statements and policy documents have been correctly disclosed in the CCADB.

Regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
